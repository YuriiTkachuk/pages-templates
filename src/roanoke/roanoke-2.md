# <center>Key People</center>

**Sir Walter Raleigh (1554 – 1618)** was a wealthy English landowner, poet, soldier and politician. He did not lead any of the expeditions to Roanoke Island himself, but he provided the money for them.

**Queen Elizabeth I (1533 – 1603)** of England wanted to establish colonies in the New World. She had seen how rich Spain had become from the gold and silver from Spanish colonies in Central and South America and wanted similar riches for England. She also thought a colony in North America would be a good place from which English ships could attack Spanish treasure ships and steal the gold and silver they were carrying. English ships and captains that had permission from the Queen to act as pirates were known as privateers.

**Sir Francis Drake (1540 – 1596)** was an English sea captain, privateer and explorer. In 1577, he sailed through the Strait of Magellan and into the Pacific Ocean in his ship the Golden Hind. He captured a huge amount of treasure from the Spanish off the coast of Peru. He then sailed north along the coast of California and then west to China. He picked up spices in China and then sailed back to England. This made him the first English sea captain to sail around the world.

**Ralph Lane (1532 – 1603)** was the governor of the first attempted colony on Roanoke Island. Some historians believe he didn’t have a good relationship with the local American Indians, and so they did not help the colonists when they ran out of food.

**John White (1540 – 1593)** was an artist, a member of the first Roanoke colony and he returned as governor of the second colony. His married daughter, Eleanor Dare, was also in the second group of colonists and gave birth to a daughter on Roanoke Island. This was the first English child born on North American land.
