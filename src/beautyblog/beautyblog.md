  It may look traditional, but scarlet never goes out of fashion and this nail polish is as red as they come! What's more it is super-easy to apply, the colour is intense after only one coat, and it doesn't chip easily. Available from all high street chemists at a special introductory price of £4.99.
  Don't miss it!"

Superdrug, the well-known high street chemist's, is branching out from selling make up, skincare products and toiletries to offering in-store beauty treatments. Among these will be anti-wrinkle injections, teeth whitening and broken vein removal.

From next week customers will be able to walk into the store for a 'lunch break' treatment. It will cost £145 for one area of the face – less than a third of the amount charged by top cosmetic surgery practitioners. The consultation will take about 15 minutes and the treatment as little as ten minutes. Superdrug will be the only high street chain where you will find top-of-the-range treatments like these available at budget prices.

As reported in national newspapers, Anish Sabherwal, Business Development Manager at Superdrug, said the new in-store beauty clinics mean that treatments once thought of as luxuries will now be accessible to everyone who wants them. He said: 'Now a customer can nip into our store during their lunch hour, get a manicure, have an anti-wrinkle consultation, choose a sandwich meal deal and head back to the office.'

It sounds great in principle, and I'm all for making treatments like these more widely available. That said, I do have some doubts about the quality and safety of super-quick, high street solutions. These treatments involve needles, strong toxins, and other products which, if used incorrectly, can cause serious problems to the person having the treatment. They should be performed by medically trained experts, not by beauty practitioners.

If you fancy popping into Superdrug for some anti-wrinkle injections, I recommend you ask to see the practitioner's qualifications. A government-backed register for providers of injectable cosmetic treatments such as botox and dermal fillers is now in operation; check that the person carrying out your treatment is on this register.

What do you think about 'lunchtime' treatments at Superdrug? Would you go for botox injections there?
