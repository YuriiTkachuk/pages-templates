# Do you want justice but don't know where to start?

If you think that you have been **wrongly dismissed**, **discriminated against**, or **unfairly treated** at work in any way, then **we can help you**!

We know that it is a very painful experience when you are **mistreated by your employer**. We understand that taking legal action can be a stressful experience.

**Contact us now on 0800 19 986 3456** or [complete our FREE online claim assessment form](#).

Last year, **more than 3,300 people used Legal Help And Action** to act against their former employers. Our highly trained and experienced team provided the **best advice, support and documentation** which you need to make sure you receive the **best settlement payments possible**- starting from a few thousand pounds, right up to tens of thousands of pounds.

We know that taking legal action against your employer is a big decision, but our experienced legal team can provide all the essential documentation, advice and support you will need to **mediate with your employer or apply to the employment tribunal for compensation or reinstatement quickly and efficiently**.

Our extensive experience has taught us that obtaining a positive outcome is not solely based on legal representation and a tribunal hearing. In fact, many employers are willing to mediate; and many prefer to resolve disputes before or during the tribunal claims procedure. Because of this, our packages are all designed to assist in mediation - meaning **it may not be necessary to appear in court**. However, if you are unable to reach a settlement then our **download, standard or deluxe** **packages** will help you initiate your claim and our **case assistance** package will help you manage it!

If you are looking for an efficient and affordable solution to obtaining your employment rights, then order any of our four packages **now**. Don't wait until it's too late. **Act Now!**
