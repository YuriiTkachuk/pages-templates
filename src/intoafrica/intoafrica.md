_15 February_

***
When I sat down at my computer to write this week's post, I found myself staring at the screen and wondering which topic to cover. Nothing pressing came to mind, so I went back to the kitchen, filled my kettle from the tap, boiled it up and made myself a strong cup of tea to improve my concentration.

As I did so, I realised what today's topic had to be. Those simple actions that I performed are taken for granted by most people who read this blog, but for more than 12 per cent of the world's population the idea of opening a tap and getting a flow of clean, potable water is nothing but a dream.

Each year more than **3 million people** in the developing world die from diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery, illnesses which are caused by not having access to a clean water supply. Four thousand children are killed by these diseases every day â€“ that's five times more than the number of children that die from HIV/AIDS and twice as many as are killed by malaria.

It is not ignorance that makes these diseases so deadly; when people have firewood or a paraffin stove they will boil up drinking water to make it safe. However, if no wood is available, poor people can do nothing but let their children drink unsterilised water even though they know it could make them seriously ill or even kill them.

There are other, less obvious, consequences of the lack of a clean water source. In most developing countries, women and girls are responsible for collecting water. This often involves long walks to and from the nearest water source, taking up time that could otherwise be spent doing domestic chores or earning money. Frequently children miss out on education as a result. In addition, the long walks, sometimes undertaken alone, leave women and girls potentially open to attack.

Water pumps would appear to be an obvious answer, as they can deliver clean water from underground sources close to where it is needed. However, the design of many pumps is complex and so, if they break down, expensive spare parts are needed or a specialist must be called to carry out repairs. All too often in Africa, a high-tech pump remains broken for several months and the villagers that used it must return to their old methods of water collection.

The charity Pump Aid has come up with an innovative way to solve this problem. The Elephant Pump, based on the Chinese rope pump design, is a cheap, effective and easily maintained way of providing water to a community. The Elephant pump is made with the help of the local communities and can be maintained and repaired by them. As a result, it is very rare to find an Elephant Pump not working.

Solutions like this, which deliver locally appropriate technology that the end users can build and maintain themselves, show development aid at its best.
