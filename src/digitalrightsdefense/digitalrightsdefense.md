## About DRD

From the web to the iPad, technologies have transformed American society and altered the way we operate as citizens, creators, communicators and consumers. But these new technologies bring risks in their wake. When freedoms in cyberspace come under attack, Digital Rights Defense (DRD) is here to protect and support you. We broke new ground when we were formed in 1991 (long before most people were even aware that the internet existed) and we continues to deal with issues concerning privacy, free speech, innovation, and consumer rights. DRD has always supported the public interest where digital rights are concerned.

Our knowledge base includes lawyers, activists, public policy analysts and technologists. By combining their talents we have waged and won several successful campaigns on behalf of the general public. Much of our work is carried out in the law courts, and we are not afraid to confront powerful organizations such as large corporations or the US government.

Lawsuits are particularly expensive and, as DRD is a nonprofit organization, we depend entirely on donations to keep our work going. Over sixty per cent of our budget is funded by individual donors. Explore the site and if you like what we are doing to protect you, your family and your business, click on Donate to help us keep up the work we're doing on your behalf.
