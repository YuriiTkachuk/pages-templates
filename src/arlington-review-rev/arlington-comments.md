    content: "I remember when trashy knock-offs of these teary, big-eyed orphan pictures were clogging up thrift stores nationwide â€“ they were the epitome of American kitsch. But, as Tim Burton's film reveals, the reality was that Walter Keane had been exploiting his wife's talents all along, and the wife's sad tale is evident in those children's eyes. Maybe those weepy waifs weren't as capricious an invention as they first appeared.",

    content: "I know that these pictures are kind of trashy, and I normally hate cutesy stuff like this, but there is something about the pictures that appeals to me. They tell a story which is much deeper than the painting itself. You find yourself wondering what has happened to those children, and you start to feel things like pity and revulsion. Personally, I think being able to evoke that sort of reaction in someone requires real talent.",

    content: "I've always loved the Keane paintings while my husband hates them. He finds them depressing. He finally to consented to having my picture of a lonely girl crying in the dark street hang in the cloakroom off our entrance hall, but he avoided it as much as he could. Like the girl in the image, it was rejected, which I find an interesting parallel.",

    content: "The best thing about my Keane painting is the reactions of my visitors. The majority find it totally creepy, and some state, quite vehemently, that they are far too depressing for a home with children in it and that I should replace them with something more happy and rosy. Do they think that children don't feel negative emotions? I think kids relate to the Keane pictures far better than to a painting of a child in some fool's paradise.",
