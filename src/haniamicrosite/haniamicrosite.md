# The City of Hania

The city of Hania is the capital of the prefecture and is its administrative, economic and commercial centre. It is built over the ruins of the ancient city of Kydonia, which flourished in prehistoric times. Throughout its history, Hania has faced many invaders and the influence of many different cultures. Each of these has left an imprint on the city, from the Minoan ruins to the Venetian harbour and the Turkish mosque and minaret. Hania is considered to be one of the most beautiful towns in Greece and the most picturesque city in Crete.
