### How to search the internet

Search engines are very easy to use, but with a little help you can learn to use them much better. While humans organize and catalog subject directories, search engines rely on computer programs called spiders or robots to crawl the Web and log the words on each page. With a search engine, keywords related to a topic are typed into a search "box." The search engine scans its database and returns a file with links to websites containing the word or words specified. Because these databases are very large, search engines often return thousands of results. Without search strategies or techniques, finding what you need can be like finding a needle in a haystack.  

To use search engines effectively, it is essential to apply techniques that give fewer but more accurate results, and which push the most relevant pages to the top of the results list. Below are a number of strategies for helping you to do this.

### Identify keywords

When you conduct a search, first break down your topic into its key concepts. For example, to find information about Chelsea football club, you could search for the keywords
##### "Chelsea football club"
The search will give you pages which contain all three words.

But we can improve this: to find information on what the UN has said about the global warming, the keywords might be:
##### "UN 'global warming'"
Notice that global warming is between quotation marks. The effect of this is to treat global warming as if it were one word. The search will give you pages which contain global warming and UN.

### Omitting keywords from the search

Suppose you want to find pages which talk about American cars, but not about Ford. You would write your search terms like this:
#### "'American cars' -chrysler"
The minus sign (-) means BUT NOT. A very useful operator!

### Capital letters? Plurals?

Search engines do not distinguish between capital and lower case letters, so don't worry about this. And if you search for bicycle (singular) it will fins bicycles (plural). But the opposite is not true- because the plural form is longer than the singular.
