# CAPITAL PUNISHMENT:
## What do the victims' families think?

<small>Names and details have been changed to protect the interviewees' privacy</small>

## PAUL LAROCHE , California

Paul Laroche's grandmother was murdered in her own home by a gang of teenage girls twenty three years ago. The ringleader of the gang was sentenced to death for the crime and became the youngest female in the state to be on death row. Although he originally supported her death sentence, Paul Laroche ended up being active in the campaign to overturn this sentence. The perpetrator is now serving a sentence of 60 years in prison.

_"I think that families want the maximum penalty allowed by law for the person who killed their loved one, but that the majority are satisfied if the sentence is life without parole, or at least a long prison sentence. The relatives of someone who has been murdered definitely need healing, but the way I see it now, the death penalty doesn't achieve that. All it does is continue the cycle of violence and create more victims."_

## RAOUL HERNANDEZ, Florida

Raoul Hernandez's 20-year-old son Rafael was shot and killed by Calvin Davis, a 15-year old boy who was dared to carry out the shooting by the leader of a gang he wanted to join. Calvin received a prison sentence of 25 years to life. Raoul joined with Calvin's grandmother to set up in-school programs that teach children non-violent methods of solving conflicts. He is also involved in societies that are working to abolish the death penalty in the United States and worldwide.

_"Of course, the grief never goes away, but after the initial shock of losing my son, I realized that the perpetrator was a victim too. How did we as a country get to a situation where kids need to join gangs in order to feel respected? And so I decided to become the enemy not of my son's killer but of the forces in our society that make a young boy shoot a total stranger who has done him no harm. Calvin writes to me from prison and we use his letters in our programs. They have a really positive effect on other kids. If that saves those kids from turning to violence, that will bring me far more healing than if he had gotten the death penalty."_

## SANDRA SCHILLER, Colorado

![Anonymous](../../assets/images/deathsentence-avatar3.png)

Sandra and Joe Schiller's daughter Amanda was murdered while attending college. Her killer was not found until five years after the crime, and had committed another murder before he was finally caught. He is now serving multiple life sentences. Sandra has spoken out against capital punishment on many occasions and has also contributed articles to state and national newspapers on the topic.

_"There is no such thing as closure when a beloved child has been torn away from you by murder. Killing Amanda's murderer won't stop us being reminded every day of the hopes and dreams she had for her life. We want the world to remember her; in fact, we believe that one effect of the death penalty is that it turns society's attention away from the victim and creates an outpouring of support for the perpetrator. For us, the death penalty is not the way to honor our daughter's life."_
