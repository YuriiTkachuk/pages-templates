Try the fish courses- but don't expect the bill to be less than £35 a head, excluding drinks. Closed Thursday.",

It's not a chain, and the meals are prepared to order. The burgers are big, and meaty. The salads are fresh. And at about £8 a head, you can't complain about the bill, either! Open for lunch and dinner Tuesday to Sunday.",

There's also a salad buffet, and several meat-free options. Great for families- there's a playroom where the kids can chill out while the grown-ups linger over coffee.",
