_By Dr Susan Vile_

A phobia is an irrational fear of, and compelling need to avoid, particular activities, situations or objects. Often there's no obvious cause but sometimes it can be traced to an earlier experience.

## What are the symptoms?

Mild symptoms of anxiety may include a dry mouth, a lump in the throat, 'butterflies' in the stomach or the need to go to the toilet more often.

When anxiety is more intense, symptoms of a panic attack may occur. These include palpitations, sweating, nausea, shortness of breath and dizziness.

The phobia interferes with everyday life because a person may go to extraordinary lengths to avoid an object or situation, potentially limiting their work, social and relationship opportunities.

## Who's affected?

About one in ten of us has a phobia and women are affected more than men. Phobias most often develop in late childhood and early adulthood.

The most common phobia is agoraphobia - a fear of open or public places, the presence of crowds and of other situations where a person feels it would be difficult to escape to a safe place.

Other common phobias include claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed areas), social phobia and fear of spiders and flying.

## What's the treatment?

It isn't possible to prevent phobias from developing. However, behaviour therapy can successfully help people to overcome many of their fears. Sometimes medication, such as antidepressant drugs, is recommended.
