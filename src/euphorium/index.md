# About us

The Euphorium is a music and arts venue in north London composed of a daytime café, small art gallery, outdoor terrace and highly-rated gigs venue.

You can visit us at any time of the day for an excellent range of coffees and teas, or pop along a bit later for one of our nightly DJ sessions. Our range of events covers everything from interactive crafts to drum'n'bass all-night raves and sophisticated smooth jazz gigs. Big names such as Basil Underground and Y? have been former guest DJs and _The Guardian_ notably described us as "a haven for enthusiasts of the alternative scene".
