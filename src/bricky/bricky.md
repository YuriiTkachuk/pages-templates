## Noel Marshall

Bricky is the brainchild of Noel Marshall. Noel (an ex-Army carpenter and farmer from Ballygarvan, Co. Cork, Eire) from his experience as a qualified tradesman understood the need for an effective and efficient bricklaying tool. During his time in the Army he had served in the Lebanon on peacekeeping duty as well as competing for the Irish Army's Cross Country Team in Poland in the European Armies Cross Country Championship.

Having pioneered Bricky, and as founder and CEO of Marshall Tools Limited, Noel is now investigating the potential of other products to aid the construction industry.

Bricky has already won three major international awards. The 'Oscar de L'Invention' was awarded to Mr Marshall at Europe's largest inventing show in Geneva in April this year as the best invention at the show – as well as scooping the 'Best Construction Invention'.

An award for excellence was given at the world's largest invention show – INPEX – in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA in May 2001\. The 'International Gold Medal' was awarded to Mr Marshall at the Tomorrow's World Inventors Show in London, England in May 2001.
