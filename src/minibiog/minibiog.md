    last_name: "Picasso",
    first_name: "Pablo",
    born: "25 October 1881",

    bio: "Pablo Ruiz y Picasso showed artistic ability from an early age, and when he began to study art seriously in Barcelona and Madrid, he was already a skilled painter. In the early 1900s he visited and eventually settled in Paris, where he was part of a vibrant artistic community. Although he was influenced by other artists in Europe and beyond, Picasso was inventive and prolific, and early in his career earned a worldwide reputation as an innovator. Along with Henri Matisse, he is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. His enormous body of work spans so many years that art experts generally separate his career into distinct phases, such as the Blue Period, the Rose Period and his most famous contribution to modern art, Cubism. Picasso, unlike so many before him, was an international celebrity as well as an important contributor to the world of art.",

    bio: "Jackson Pollock grew up in California and Arizona, but moved to New York in 1930, where he studied painting under painter Thomas Hart Benton. Pollock suffered from alcoholism and began undergoing psychiatric treatment in the late 1930s; he had a nervous breakdown in 1938 and was hospitalized briefly. He had his first one-man show in 1943. By the late 1940s he had developed a process for which he became famous - dripping or pouring paint onto canvasses that he had laid out on the floor. Pollock believed that art derived from the unconscious and that this method was an authentic method of personal expression, His style became known as abstract expressionism, and he was the main proponent of this art movement. Pollock died in a car accident near his home on Long Island, New York.",
