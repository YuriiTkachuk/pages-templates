## Romantic films

###### With Valentine' s Day coming up soon, here are five of my favourite romantic movies.

### Titanic (1997)

In addition to the love story, this film combines the drama of a disaster movie with a sub-plot of the hunt for a missing diamond necklace, believed to be on the wreck of the Titanic, the famous ship that hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912 and sank.

Rose, an aristocratic young girl, is travelling with her mother and her rich American fiancé Cal. Rose does not love Cal but marriage to him will solve her and her mother's financial problems. Unhappy about her engagement, Rose goes down to the third class deck and attempts to commit suicide but a handsome young third class passenger called Jack Dawson stops her from jumping overboard. Over the next couple of days Rose and Jack spend time together secretly and fall in love with each other. In her cabin Jack draws a sketch of Rose wearing only the diamond necklace that was Cal's engagement present to her. Afterwards, the pair escape from Cal's bodyguard, and make love in the ship's cargo hold. On the way back to the upper decks they see that the ship has hit an iceberg and hear the officers saying that the damage is serious and that there are not enough lifeboats for all the passengers.

Rose gets into a lifeboat but realizes that she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board the Titanic. Cal takes a pistol and chases the lovers into the flooding first-class dining saloon but then escapes on one of the last lifeboats. Jack and Rose plunge into the sea as the ship breaks in half. Jack helps Rose onto a floating piece of wood that is big enough to support only one person. A lifeboat comes looking for survivors and Rose is saved but Jack has frozen to death in the cold water.

### Romeo and Juliet (1968)

This classic love story by Shakespeare has been performed countless times on stage and several film versions have been made. My favourite is the 1968 version directed by Zeffirelli.

Whichever film adaptation you like best, no-one can fail to be moved by the classic tale of two young lovers from warring families, the Montagues and the Capulets, in medieval Verona. Romeo and Juliet meet at a ball given by her father, Capulet, who hopes to marry Juliet to Count Paris. After the ball Romeo waits near the Capulets' house and talks to Juliet when she appears on her balcony. With the help of Juliet’s Nurse they arrange to meet next day at the cell of the priest Friar Lawrence and they are married by him in secret.

In a quarrel Romeo's friend Mercutio is accidentally killed by Juliet's cousin Tybalt. Romeo pursues Tybalt in anger, kills him and is told he must leave Verona forever as a punishment. With Friar Lawrence’s help Romeo spends the night with Juliet before escaping to the sown of Mantua.

To calm the family’s sorrow at Tybalt’s death, Capulet brings forward the day for the marriage of Juliet to Paris. unaware that his daughter has already married Romeo. Friar Lawrence gives Juliet a sleeping potion that will make everyone think she’s dead. When the wedding party arrives to collect Juliet the next day they think she is dead. The Friar sends a colleague to tell Romeo to come and rescue his sleeping wife from the Capulet family tomb but the message doesn’t get through. Instead Romeo hears of Juliet's “death” and buys poison in Mantua.

Romeo returns to Verona, goes to the tomb and takes the poison and dies just as Juliet awakes from her drugged sleep. She learns what has happened from Friar Lawrence and stabs herself. The deaths of their children lead the Montague and Capulet families to make peace at last.

### Pretty Woman (1990)

Some people find this film a bit cheesy, but I have a soft spot for this modern take on the classic Cinderella story.

Edward Lewis, a rich but unhappy businessman from New York, gets lost while driving in Los Angeles. A pretty girl he asks for directions offers to help him drive to his hotel. The girl, Vivian, turns out to be a prostitute. They spend the night together and in the morning he asks her if she will spend the next week with him and accompany him to various social events associated with his business trip. Vivian agrees and can hardly believe her luck because he is attractive and will pay her well. With help from Edward and the hotel manager, Vivian is transformed from a pretty but trashily-dressed girl into an elegant and beautiful young lady who manages to convince everyone they meet that she is Edward's new girlfriend.

In the course of the week they fall in love with each other and Vivian helps Edward to see that his obsession with making money by buying out companies is making him unhappy and that he really should be running businesses that create useful products and bring people employment.

Edward offers to buy a flat for Vivian and look after her so that she can give up prostitution and they can spend more time together. She refuses, saying that she wants more from her life than to spend it as a rich man's mistress. She decides to leave town and use the money he gave her to continue her education, but at the end of the film he comes looking for her and the audience are left to understand that they will end up getting married.

### Love Story (1970)

Told as a flashback, this movie has little in the way of plot but is one of the all-time great “weepies”.

Oliver Barrett IV comes from a family of wealthy and well-respected Harvard University graduates. At Radcliffe library, he meets and falls in love with Jennifer Cavilleri, a working-class, music student. Their love overcomes their very different social backgrounds but his father disapproves of the relationship and cuts off Oliver's financial support.

The couple marry and struggle to survive financially as Oliver goes on to train as a lawyer and Jennifer works to support them both, but he finally gets a well-paid job at a law firm and they decide they can now afford to start a family. Jennifer fails to conceive and in the course of fertility tests it is discovered that she has a fatal disease and is dying. Oliver asks his father for financial help to pay for Jennifer's expensive treatment, but his father again refuses to help.

Jennifer finally dies while lying in Oliver's arms on her hospital bed.

### Jane Eyre (1996)

This is another classic story that has been adapted many times for both the big and the small screen. My favourite is again one directed by Zeffirelli, in 1996\.

Jane Eyre is poor and plain and, as an orphan, forced to make her own way in the world. She is hired to work at Thornfield Hall as a governess for Adele, the daughter of Mr. Rochester, a mysterious and moody man who is tormented by secrets in his past. Rochester and Jane fall in love and a date is set for their wedding. Jane does not know that Rochester is already married and that Bertha, his mentally ill wife, lives locked up on the top floor of Thornfield Hall where she is looked after by a nurse. The marriage is stopped by Bertha's brother Richard Mason and Jane runs away.

Later Jane discovers she is now a wealthy woman, having inherited a fortune from a long-lost uncle in Madeira. She gets a proposal of marriage from a clergyman but is still in love with Rochester. She goes back to look for him and finds Thornfield Hall has been burnt down. Bertha had started the fire and Rochester tried to in vain save her, becoming crippled and blinded in the process. Jane nurses Rochester back to health, he recovers his eyesight and they marry.
