The atmosphere is interesting and fun, the staff are friendly, the music is a great selection (and loud enough to be heard but quiet enough not to interfere with conversation), and the food is very tasty! It's especially nice if you're a vegetarian, or someone who doesn't want to eat meat all the time. They have a bunch of vegetarian options, including a vegetarian version of the English breakfast that is delicious...",

The music playing in the restaurant was really great too. They seemed to be playing a lot of the music of famous artists who have performed there. The food was very good. I wouldn't go here for the food specifically, but the combination of good food, drink and atmosphere is well worth it. I hope we can come back sometime for dinner and then listen to the live music in the basement.",

We ordered some cocktails and, being that this was our first meal in London, the fish and chips.  The cocktails were well priced and generous.  The fish and chips were OK but according to other reviews, they have other dishes that are much better and probably less touristy.  I would have loved to see live music here!  The decor at this place is awesome.",

# Overview #

Established in 1954, The Minstrel is one of London’s few remaining coffee houses of the beatnik era. The club was one of several London coffee house venues at which notable musicians of the 1960s played, including Dylan Robertson, The Gathering Moss, and Los Pajaros.

The Minstrel is now a thriving cafe-bar and restaurant with a club which continues to host live music and poetry, mainly by performers who, in the club's tradition, write their own material. The performance space has doubled in size over the years yet remains an intimate venue of just 120 seats. The Café is open every day and you can come any time (before midnight); eat or drink whatever you like whenever you like; stay as long as you like (again, up to midnight).

Their menu is a mix of The Minstrel’s classics – crêpes, burgers, steaks, salads – with daily specials. They also offer daily soups dependent on what is available at the market and have a daily ‘one pot wonder’ and fresh soups, so do go in between midday and 4pm to make sure you don’t go hungry, no matter how short your lunch break!
