# Black Truffles

## Tuber melanosporum

<right>![](../../assets/images/truffle1.jpg)</right>

Black Truffles, also known as Perigord Truffles or Black French Truffles, are edible mushrooms which grow underground on the roots of trees, especially oak trees. They are found in France, Italy and Spain, but those which grow in the regions of Perigord and Lot in south-west France are widely considered to be the finest in the world.

Black Truffles are highly valued by gourmets for their typical flavour, which is reminiscent of fresh earth and mushrooms. They are also extremely aromatic; when fresh, their scent can fill an entire room.

These truffles have a thick, greyish-black skin with small diamond-shaped projections on it. They can reach up to 7 cm in diameter and weigh between 10 and 100 grams, though the majority are at the lower end of that range. They grow on the roots of oaks in a circular formation, about 1.5 metres from the base of the oak tree and at a depth of about 30cm from the surface of the earth. The fact that they grow below the earth's surface is thought to be an adaptive measure that helps them survive drought, low temperatures and forest fires, while mushrooms that live above ground are more prone to destruction.

Harvesting truffles is a delicate and uncertain process. Because they are underground, humans cannot detect them, but animals with an acute sense of smell are able to do so. Traditionally pigs were used to locate truffles as their excellent sense of smell made them efficient truffle hunters. However, they have some drawbacks. Like humans, pigs adore the taste of truffles, so there is a high risk of them eating what they find. In addition, pigs tire rather quickly and are not easy to transport. For these reasons, dogs have replaced pigs as truffle hunters in most regions. Dogs are not keen on the taste of truffles and can be trained to show their handlers when they have located a truffle from its smell and are happy to be rewarded with a treat. In recent years, some research has gone into developing electronic "noses" to locate truffles underground, but they still require work.

So far, the practice of cultivating Black Truffles has met with limited success but is being pursued in several countries, including Australia and New Zealand.
