rightcol_text: Despite what should be the great advantage of having a Cretan spouse, in my early days here I found myself frequently plunged into situations where I made embarrassing mistakes through my ignorance of various local customs. I like to think this was not due to any malice on my spouse's part, but more to the fact that Cretans don't explain things (unless you specifically ask) as they assume you know them already. This blog is therefore intended to help you avoid making a fool of yourself with Cretan friends or neighbours.

## New Year in Crete

As a Scot, I am of course well-acquainted with the Scottish habit of first footing, in which a man, preferably a dark (though not necessarily tall or handsome) stranger, is invited to be the first person over your threshold in the New Year. Ideally, this stranger should be carrying a lump of coal to symbolise warmth in the house throughout the year. This symbolic action in Scotland is carried out soon after midnight, then people rush back indoors to continue drinking and partying. Any passing friends, neighbours or strangers (ideally, tall, dark and handsome in this case) are welcome to come in and join the fun.

Given the reputation of Greek people for being fun-loving, I assumed something similar would take place in Crete. Far from it! On my first New Year's Eve in Crete, we had an evening meal at my father-in-law's house then all the men of the household departed to the nearest cafe to play cards and dice, leaving my mother-in-law and me to watch TV and make small talk using hand gestures and my twenty words of Greek. The menfolk returned just before midnight, everyone went outside, a token gunshot was fired and then an argument broke out which seemed to be about who should re-enter the house first. Finally I was marched to the threshold, a stone was placed in my hand, and my husband instructed me to enter with the right foot first and place the stone in a corner of the living-room. After that everyone settled down to watch more TV. The most exciting event of the whole evening was when my father-in-law almost choked on the good luck coin hidden inside the special New Year cake and had to be banged vigorously on the back until he coughed it up again.

The following day, feeling a bit homesick, I suggested inviting a girlfriend of mine, a fellow Scot, round to our house. My husband put a stop to that idea instantly and finally explained the rules of first footing in Crete to me. Apparently, it is very important that you choose carefully who is the first person to cross your threshold in the New Year, as that person will determine the luck that the household has for the rest of the year. For this reason, children, being considered innocent, are the favourite choice; the stone that is carried into a relative or neighbour's house symbolises strength to the house and its occupants.

For several days after New Year, Cretan villagers avoid visiting other people's houses for fear of being accused of having brought bad luck if anything unfortunate happens to the family later in the year. I have seen people stand in the street and shout to the householder to ask if anyone has already set foot on the property that year before they dare to enter even the courtyard.

So, if you feel tempted to go visiting at this time of year â€“ you have been warned! Check before you enter!
