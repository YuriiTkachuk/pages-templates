### Menus

We have two main menus:

*   Our bar snacks menu, which serves pub classics and nibbles. It is available lunchtimes and evenings (except for some very busy Friday and Saturday nights when our chef may need to stop serving bar snacks).
*   Our a la carte menu is available lunchtimes and evenings and is always changing depending on the season. You can see our current [menu here](#). We suggest that parties of 10 or more people order their food when they book.

### Sundays

On Sundays we serve traditional roast dinners with all the trimmings and our full bar snacks menu.

### Quality

All our meat, fish and produce are bought from local suppliers and we are well known for only using the finest ingredients. We have a wide range of wines and local beers to match to the food so you will definitely want to come and enjoy a meal with us – whether for the first time or you are one of many happy returning customers!

### Special occasions
