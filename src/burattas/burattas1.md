## About us

We are a traditional pub serving delicious home-style food in the heart of the countryside. We have a large range of local drinks, are fully wheelchair accessible and provide a large car park for our customers. When the weather is nice you can enjoy a drink in our beautiful beer garden complete with our very own duck pond, as well as the pub's chickens which roam free around the garden.
