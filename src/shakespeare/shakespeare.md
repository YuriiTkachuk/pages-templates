# _Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day_
## - Sonnet XVIII by William Shakespeare

![Summer flowers](../assets/images/shakespeare-summer.jpg)

Shakespeare’s eighteenth sonnet is, perhaps, one of the best-known sonnets in English literature. In the poem, and with characteristic skill, Shakespeare uses the characteristics of the sonnet form to exalt poetry and his beloved. He adapts and extends the conventions of the sonnet form to express his ideas in a new and brilliant way.

The first quatrain introduces the primary conceit of the sonnet: he compares the speaker’s beloved to a summer’s day. In the very first line he introduces the conceit. Then, he builds on this comparison when he writes, “Thou art more lovely and more temperate” (line 2). Here he is describing his beloved in a way that could also describe summer. When he describes “rough winds [that] do shake the darling buds of May,” (line 3) he uses the idea of _rough winds_ as a metaphor for capricious chance and change, and he implies that his beloved does not suffer from these winds as summer does. The first quatrain, therefore, introduces a comparison that will be expanded in the remaining two quatrains.

The second quatrain strengthens the comparison of the beloved to a summer’s day. The speaker anthropomorphizes the sky, or “heaven,” (line 5) by using the metaphor of an “eye” (line 5) for the sun so that the comparison between a person and a season becomes more vivid. By assigning heaven an “eye,” the speaker invokes the image of his beloved’s eyes. Similarly, in the next line when the speaker mentions that summer’s “gold complexion” is often “dimmed,” (line 6) he is attempting to compare another human attribute of his beloved with a trait of summer. We can see that the second quatrain presents summer as possessing only _mutable_ beauty.

The third quatrain no longer focuses on the mutability of summer, but it speaks of the nearly eternal nature of the memory of the beloved. The speaker assures his beloved that her “eternal summer shall not fade,” (line 9) - he is using summer as a metaphor for her beauty. Using the word “fade” facilitates the comparison of the abstract notion of a summer’s day to the concrete person of the beloved because fading is a quality of light. Similarly, when the speaker writes of the beloved entering the “shade” (line 10) of death, he is expanding on the use of the metaphor and reinforcing the poem’s primary conceit. When he boasts that his beloved will not suffer the same fate as a summer’s day because he has committed her to “eternal lines,” (line 12) he adds the theme of poetry itself to a sonnet that had previously been a love poem. Shakespeare gives his beloved immortality through poetry; and that is something that God did not give to a summer’s day.

The final couplet concludes the poem by tying together the themes of love and poetry. In it the speaker starkly contrasts the life-spans of his poem (and therefore of his beloved’s memory) to the fleeting nature of a summer’s day. He boasts that, unlike a summer’s day, his poetry and the memory of his beloved will last “so long as men can breathe or eyes can see” (line 13). This last comparison provides a stark contrast to the time period, “a summer’s day,” (line 1) introduced at the beginning of the sonnet. It exalts both poetry and the beloved.

Shakespeare deliberately used a conventional form of poetry to praise both poetry and his beloved. He boasted that both would be preserved nearly eternally. Five hundred years later, no one can refute that claim.
