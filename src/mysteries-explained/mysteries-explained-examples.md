# Common examples of urban legends

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of urban legends and the number is always growing. Here is a small selection of some classic examples:

## Alligators in the sewer
 ![](../../assets/images/mysteries-explained-img01.jpg)

The story goes that people living in New York used to go on holiday to Florida and bring back small baby alligators for their children to raise as pets. When they realised that these animals don’t stay small and cute for long they flushed them down the toilet! Some of these alligators managed to survive and breed in the sewers beneath New York City where they still live today!

**Analysis** - This was a very commonly told tale and is believed to have been started over fifty years ago. These are huge predators and need plenty of food to survive - maybe there are enough rats in the sewers for them to live off. Space certainly wouldn’t be an issue as the New York sewer system is huge. However, the fact is that alligators are cold blooded animals and so they can only survive in warm environments. The New York sewers are cold - freezing cold - so this one is not true.

## Organ harvesting  ![](../../assets/images/mysteries-explained-img05.jpg)

This story has many forms but its most famous takes place in New Orleans. Around the time of the Mardi Gras festival there was a story that unsuspecting tourists were being drugged on a night out. The tourist would then wake up the next day in a hotel room in a bathtub of ice, with a scar along their back. When they went to hospital they found out that a gang had removed a kidney to sell it on the black market!

**Analysis** - This is also a very commonly told tale with versions of it being told all over the world. It might be true that body parts are bought and sold and maybe in some parts of the world people could choose to sell a kidney on the black market but not in these situations. There is no evidence of kidneys ever being removed without a person’s consent and no victims have ever come forward. Removing and transporting organs requires a lot of specialized equipment, a sterilized operating room, and trained doctors and there is no way that it could be done in hotel rooms like this.

## Microwaved pet ![](../../assets/images/mysteries-explained-img06.jpg)

In this story a friend of a friend has a grandmother who had a small pet dog. She gave it a bath one day and was about to start drying it with a towel. The phone rang and it was her daughter reminding her that they were supposed to meet for lunch. The grandmother apologised for being late and said she would be there as quickly as possible. She went back to her wet dog and put it in the microwave, set it to low and went to get her coat on. A minute later she heard a muffled explosion from the kitchen. Her beloved little dog was no more!

**Analysis** - This story first became popular in the 1970s. It serves as a warning about social attitudes towards technological change. This story might have happened at some point, remember though, just because a story is an urban legend does not mean it isn’t true. However, the speaker will have no evidence to back it up. They simply hear it and then pass it on to somebody else. This is the defining characteristic of an urban legend.
