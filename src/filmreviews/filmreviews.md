    text1: "Touching the Void leaves you emotionally and physically spent, and grateful it was only a movie, not a mountain, you had to endure. Two men, Yates and Simpson, dare to challenge one of the most difficult environments on the planet, using as little equipment as possible. Their story alone would make anything worth sitting through, but is complemented here by a gripping narrative, superb reconstructions, and some absolutely astonishing cinematography. Their story shows the human capacity to withstand what will seem to you like some of the most unbelievable conditions, to make the hardest decision you can ever imagine, and to keep going despite everything- and this documentary renders the entire situtation in stunning clarity. It's a film no-one should miss. Most movies of this type re-create the action far from the actual scene of the crime, but Macdonald has invented a new subgenre: a docudrama in which the docu and the drama are equally authentic. And even if most of us can only imagine how it feels to climb a mountain, we can all empathise with the mountaineer's reluctance to get out of a warm sleeping bag to make the first cup of tea of the day. As a result, when we come to the great questions of the film- the choice of abandoning a friend to certain death or facing one's own; crawling in agony for miles over rocks and ice; realizing that, whatever happens, help won't come; and, driven by determination not to go down without a fight, surviving against all odds to tell the tale - we are utterly engaged and enthralled. After trying to pull Simpson up for over an hour, Yates cut the rope. And we all understand why.The real strength of the film lies in its capacity to make you realise how through sheer willpower and determination human beings are capable of very extraordinary things; you will be a better person for having seen this film.",

    text2: "For a movie like this, touching the void just isn't enough. It has to touch the audience, too. It fails utterly to do so. I suppose if you are a mountaineer you might conceivably find it wonderful. But most of us aren't, and have better things to do with our days than waste time on meaningless macho adventuring. Before we talk about the film, let's be clear about the endeavour the film narrates: if I were to embark on a trip along a remote motorway, in blizzard conditions, without taking a shovel or any water with me, I would rightly be branded an idiot. This is more or less what our two intrepid mountain boys do, only at higher altitude: so I will not concede that this dangerously foolish escapade is in any way the pinnacle of human endeavour that many seem to think it. In a world where human suffering is rife, this account of a foolish recreational pursuit gone desperately awry just seems vainglorious and shallow. In fairness, at one point in the film Simpson admits that the expedition was under-prepared, and I suppose it is to his credit that he tells his story in such a way that we understand quite clearly that the disaster was completely avoidable. Don't, whatever you do, believe the hype about this silly journey. This reconstruction of the mid-eighties mountain climb in the Andes was a pretty boring couple of hours, made much worse by the appearance of the two original climbers, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson. They don't seem interested in the film. They're just there for the close-ups, it seems. And after two hours, I still don't know which of the two is the more self-absorbed, mixed up or belligerent. Neither is in any way likeable- and though I think on balance Simpson would never have cut the rope, if their situations had been reversed- but in the end I just don't care. They're each as boring as the other. When it comes down to it, the expedition and the film are of a piece: deathly dull. If you are an intelligent rational human being, they just don't make it at all. The feeling is entirely wrong, the 'action' sequences don't look as though they are real and I had the constant feeling (despite wanting initially at least to be fully taken in) that I was always watching something where there was a camera crew, sound guys and post production effects spliced on. The expedition was hype, and so is the film. See it if you must, but you will be very disappointed.",
