    text2: "The unpretentious Medina Hotel stands on a busy tree-lined side street in the New Town near the city center. It is very popular with young travellers and tour operators. It is a modern building in traditional Moroccan style. The entrance hall is large and impressive. Rooms are small and clean, with well-appointed bathrooms. For a quieter stay, ask for one of the newer rooms at the back of the hotel in the annex.",

      her1: ["0524/55-79-39", "405 Rue Ismail, Medina, Marrakesh", "Price: $", "Advantages: Great place to meet fellow travellers, right on the main square. Cheap, especially if you sleep on the terrace.", "Disadvantages: Can be rather noisy"],
      text1: "You can have a simply furnished room or you can sleep on the crowded roof terrace. All rooms have en suite baths, and there is free Wi-Fi, as well as a 24-hour exchange office. You can see the Old Market from the balconies, and some rooms have private balconies which look onto the Koutoubia Gardens.",
      title2: "La Bamounia",
      her2: ["0524/38-91-00", "Jdid el Fna, Medina, Marrakesh", "Price: $$$$$", "Advantages: One of the best hotels in the world", "Disadvantages: Rooms are small. Very expensive."],
      text2: "This is a luxury hotel fit for kings, presidents and rock stars. Since it opened in 1923, La Bamounia has always been one of the very best hotels in the world. The hotel is in 20 acres of fragrant gardens that once belonged to 18th-century Prince Bamoun. The hotel is a perfect example of traditional Moroccan architecture. It is famous for its opulence, grandeur, celebrity guest list -and very high prices. A private bungalow in the gardens will cost about $9,000 per night. Other prices start at 'only' $700 for a room in the main hotel. Breakfast is not included, and costs $40 per person. The restaurant is absolutely excellent- and the prices show this.",

    her1: ["0524/64-38-05", "3, Sidi Bouloukate, Medina, Marrakesh", "Price: $", "Advantages: Great value, central location", "Disadvantages: No private bathrooms"],
    text1: "This hotel is without doubt the best value in town. There are no private bathrooms- you must share bath facilities with other guests. There is one shower and one toilet per floor but otherwise the hotel is perfect, and very cheap. The rooms are small but very nice and the staff is very helpful. The rooftop terrace has meals and snacks all day long, and you're just a twist and a turn away from the old market.",
