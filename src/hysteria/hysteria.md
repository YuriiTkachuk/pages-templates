## Hysteria

Hysteria – the disease of the womb – once afflicted huge numbers of women. According to most (male!) doctors between 1830 and 1930 it was the single biggest health problem for women. Yet today, the disease has completely disappeared from our medical horizons. What happened, and where did the disease go?

In 1859 it was claimed that a quarter of all women suffered from hysteria. Dr George Beard, in what came to be considered the standard text book on the disease, catalogued an incredible seventy-five pages of possible symptoms of hysteria - and still called his list incomplete. The sheer variety of the symptoms he catalogued was so wide that in fact almost any ailment could fit the diagnosis; and his list often fell into open contradiction with itself. A woman who suffered from faintness (or its opposite, boldness) was hysterical. If she felt nervousness, or didn't feel nervousness, she was hysterical; the presence (or the absence!) of sexual desire could indicate the condition; so did both insomnia and sleepiness... with a list like that, you could label just about anyone as ill.

But they didn't label just about anyone. They labelled women. Mental ill-health was increasingly associated with menstruation, pregnancy, and the menopause- all of them functions of the womb, and therefore by definition feminine. On the basis of no evidence whatsoever, medical opinion decided that a woman's womb could actually move around inside her body, and that her mental health would depend on where it happened to stop. They said that the womb acted like an enormous sponge which could suck a woman's vital energy (if it stopped near her heart or liver) or sap her intellect (if it went near to her brain). Men, who had no womb, did not suffer from such “irrational” illnesses, and were therefore inherently biologically superior.

However, on Dr Beard's catalogue, the most telling symptom of all was the “general tendency to cause trouble". Women's roles were changing as quickly as society itself changed, and many women themselves were less willing to stay in their proper place than their mothers and grandmothers had done. The newly-formed male medical world was quick to respond to any tentative increase in individual female assertiveness: the diagnosis of hysteria was part and parcel of the political control of women, in all fields. "Hysteria" and its variants nervousness and neurasthenia rapidly became a standard part of the vocabulary not only of obstetrics and gynecology, but also of psychiatry, neurology- and of politics. Many men pontificated about the dangers of cities, or of the education of women, or of allowing women to work or to vote. the freedom of women would cause hysteria on a scale hardly to be imagined, and certainly not to be tolerated.

But oddly enough, for some reason hysteria did not affect all women equally: the lower classes, and those who worked in the fields, were somehow immune. Perhaps it was because their (sic) 'animal spirits' protected them just as their lack of 'culture' prevented them from gentility. Throughout the Victorian period, the prevailing opinion amongst physicians was that the stresses associated with modern life would necessarily cause civilized women to be both more susceptible to nervous disorders and to develop faulty reproductive tracts. How sick your women were, became a measure of your degree of civilisation. Even in the republican United States, the increase in hysterical disorders in women reaffirmed that the U.S. was on par with Europe, and no longer a backward or undeveloped place. American physicians expressed pleasure that the country was ”catching up” to Europe in the prevalence of hysteria. Civilised women, it would seem, would be by definition hysterical wherever they were.
