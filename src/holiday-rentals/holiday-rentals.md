## About Essaouira

Essaouira is a charming ancient medina (walled town), with a 3 mile-long beach and a small picturesque working fishing port. The medina consists of a maze of narrow old streets in which you will find souks selling local crafts, clothes and spices. There are also restaurants offering a variety of Moroccan, French and Italian cuisine. Cars are not allowed inside the medina as it is a UNESCO world heritage site.

## Things to do in the area

There are plenty of activities on offer including windsurfing, walking, cycling, quad biking and camel or horse riding. Fishing day trips can be arranged from the busy little harbour. Car hire or coach trips are available if you want to explore the mountains further inland.
