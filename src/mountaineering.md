# Why climb mountains?

It always comes back to one question: "Why climb mountains?"

That's not a question you can answer for another person. I can't answer it for you. But I can answer it for me. Everyone has their limits - but few choose to test them. Most people are happy to stay well within their limits, happy and safe and encircled. But some of us are not like that. I'm not like that.

But once- not very long ago in real time but eons back in psychological time - I was like that too. I didn't know where my limits were, much less whether I could push them back. Then I went up my very first mountain.

It was about six years ago. It was a 4,000 foot peak in the northeast USA, mostly serious hiking but with a long stretch of pseudo-rock climbing on the way down. I had never done anything like it before, and was seriously unfit. That was when I discovered the joy of pushing back the limits. I went up, and down again, in one day. Nine gruelling hours for only nine linear kilometres.

I wanted to quit at least 100 different times; there were seven or eight points when I honestly didn't think I could keep going. During the final mile-long stretch, as we hopped from rock to rock on our way down the mountain, my legs were like jelly. I had nothing left. I needed to stop. I wanted help. I wanted a helicopter or something.

And then it happened: a surge of pride that swelled from somewhere inside me. "Just keep going." I told myself. I stopped complaining. I stopped whining. I ignored the pain and focused my attention on the trail immediately ahead, just hopping from one rock to the next on my wobbly legs, trusting my momentum, trusting my balance and trusting this bizarre force that wouldn't allow me to quit. I honestly didn't care whether I lived or died. I gave myself up to this force. I trusted it inexplicably and completely.

And I made it. I couldn't walk for five days afterwards … but I had made it. It was both humbling and exalting. I was humbled beyond belief. I was so unfit, and the others – some of them girls! - were happily going back and forwards, up and down, chattering away whilst I had to concentrate utterly on going forwards. But I shall never forget that moment when I was staggering down the mountain — in all honesty, I was completely, utterly, totally out of gas — and yet something kept pushing me forward. I learned something about myself that day. I found that I am stronger than I thought.

And until you've been there, until you've been in that exact position: at the absolute end of your rope, ready to quit on yourself … and yet you don't quit, because a mysterious force keeps pushing you forward. If you're lucky, it swallows you whole and carries you the rest of the way.

If you're lucky.
