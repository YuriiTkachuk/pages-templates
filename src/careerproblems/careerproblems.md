# Career problems? Go abroad!

**David Summerskill** investigates a new phenomenon: gap years for the over 35s

We all know about the gap year for young people: when young people take time out for a long trip between school and university. In that year, sometimes they just travel. Or they work. Sometimes they do volunteer work in a project in a poor country somewhere. Sometimes they mix and match all three options. But generally when they return home they are more mature and better able to cope with the changes that adult life will bring. We all believe that the experience of a gap year between school and university is positive.

And now the gap year is becoming more and more popular with another group: adults in mid-career. Whilst 18 and 19 year olds ar still leaving in large numbers, more and more older people are also now turning to the gap year to augment their CV.

> ## Case Studies

>A number of the professionals now venturing overseas did not have an opportunity to take a gap year when they were younger, but have seen others reap the benefits.

>"People who finished school or university and went straight into work are realising they haven't done anything like that. They are saying: 'If I don't do this now when am I going to do it?'," said Tracy Bromfield, the director of Vivisto, a gap year company. "They are looking to take a few months off to re-evaluate what has happened to them, and to decide what they are going to do."

>Eimear, a 25-year-old investment banker from the Irish Republic, worked in finance for three years, most recently as a structured products analyst in the investment arm of a German bank in Dublin, before it was taken over last year. She decided to leave Ireland, and the prospect of redundancy, in August, and is travelling in Africa and Asia with her partner, also a former investment banker. She plans to seek a new job in Hong Kong early next year.

>Alltracks, which organises skiing instructor courses in Canada has seen a recent surge in bookings from "thirtysomething" professionals – some of whom have been made redundant. Bookings have risen by 50 per cent in the past three weeks.

Is the economy difficult, and have you lost your job? Or are you bored, and do you need a change? Is your job dull, and not leading anywhere? Or have your children finally finished their education, and can you take some time for yourself at last? Then why not work for free in a poor country for six months.

The gap year in mid-career gives you time for thought and reflection, and improves your CV at the same time. Most mid-career gappers work in fields that are in some way related to their careers; and they work in projects for recognised organisations, rather than just setting off overland with a backpack. Very few seem just to travel for the sake of it. So managers may well find themselves working on conservation projects in the African savannah, doctors operating in rural Asia, dentists pulling teeth in Borneo and – well, you get the idea.

There are several organisations that work in this field. The best known has always been VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) with over 120 different projects throughout the world, but other smaller organisations also exist. Alltracks has been organising mid-career placements for adults for fifteen years, and offers extensive training courses for those interested in this option. According to their spokesman, a lot of large companies are very willing to allow their staff time to volunteer in the third world. 'Companies realise thatb the eperience enriches the people who go, and that when they return to their jobs they will bring those benefits back to the company too.' they told me. And Raleigh International, which works largely in projects to save or improve the environment, reported that more people over 35 than ever before are enquiring about their packages, and taking them up. In fact, for those commercial companies who organise in this sector, the over-30s are now much more profiable than school-leavers. In fact, with the global crisis in tourism and travel, this is one of the few groups in expansion.

So: bored? In a rut? Want a change? Take a gap year!
