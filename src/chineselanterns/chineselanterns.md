# Chinese Lanterns spark False Alarm

The lanterns were mistaken for distress flares prompting calls to the Coastguard.

A spokeman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said:

_"Although people may phone in to pre-warn the Coastguard of a Chinese lantern release, when you receive a flare report you always have to investigate properly as in the midst of the Chinese Lanterns there could be a genuine distress._

_While not wanting to be a spoilsport and ruin peoples enjoyment I also don't want to ruin peoples chances of being rescued by dismissing their distress signal as a Chinese lantern. Perhaps people could find an alternative means of celebrating, which, in turn, would mean that the Rescue Services can be available to do their proper job - saving lives - and not being sent out on false alerts."_

Chinese lanterns are becoming popular at celebrations such as birthdays and they create a dazzling display. They only cost about £2 each and are often released in groups and can be seen for up to 20 minutes during which time they can rise up to a mile high.

Chinese lanterns have also been found to be the cause of UFO reports.
