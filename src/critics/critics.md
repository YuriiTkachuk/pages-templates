## Eliot and his critics

Eliot’s poetry was first heavily criticized as not being poetry at all: its severest critics even held it to be a pretentious mixture of the banal and the stolen. They attacked his practice of the widespread interweaving of quotations from other authors into his work. Eliot himself made this criticism easier in some respects, since he published Notes on the Waste Land at the same time as the poem, and in this document he gives the source of many (but not all) of the works he quoted in the poem itself. It was therefore comparatively easy to see the poem as a long list of lines stolen from other writers. Eliot however defended this as a necessary salvaging of tradition in an age of fragmentation, and insisted that the quotations were completely integral to his work, adding depth and richness through unexpected juxtaposition. His critics of course maintained that this practice simply showed a lack of originality, and called it by an ugly name in literature: plagiarism.

Two examples will suffice: the prominent critic F. W. Bateson published an essay called aggressively _T. S. Eliot: The Poetry of Pseudo-Learning_ <sup>1</sup> while the poet himself replied in _The Sacred Wood:_

> _Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different._ <sup>2</sup>

Many famous fellow writers and critics have paid tribute to Eliot. According to the contemporary poet Ted Hughes,

>_Each year Eliot’s presence reasserts itself at a deeper level, to an audience that is surprised to find itself more chastened, more astonished, more humble._<sup>3</sup>

and the literary critic Hugh Kenner commented,

>_He has been the most gifted and influential literary critic in English in the twentieth century._ <sup>4</sup>

However, other writers have been less generous. In one of his more pungent criticisms, Samuel Beckett suggested that Eliot’s work “properly belonged in what the reverse of "T. Eliot" spells” <sup>5</sup> while C. S. Lewis – the Christian author of the _Chronicles of Narnia_ - thought Eliot’s literary criticism "superficial and unscholarly" and "a very great evil" <sup>6</sup> - even though in 1943 he wrote a letter to Eliot, expressing both admiration and antagonism:

>_I hope the fact that I find myself often contradicting you in print gives no offence; it is a kind of tribute to you—whenever I fall foul of some widespread contemporary view about literature I always seem to find that you have expressed it most clearly. One aims at the officers first in meeting an attack!_ <sup>7</sup>

Nevertheless, as time passed after the publication of The Waste Land in 1922, it came to be considered by many to be the single most influential poetic work of the twentieth century. Eliot’s reputation grew to nearly mythic proportions and by 1930, and for the next thirty years, he was the most dominant figure in poetry and literary criticism in the English-speaking world.
