## Those foreign dishes that have become British

#### Many dishes we now consider essentially British were originally imported from abroad, and though today they are in everyday use, once they were considered rich and strange. Let's look at the origins of some.

#### Soufflé

From the French word meaning 'to blow', soufflés are light, fluffy baked cakes made with egg yolks and egg whites combined with other ingredients for flavour. They can be sweet (chocolate soufflé is divine!) or savoury- cheese soufflé is a classic dish.

#### Curry

Curry is a generic term used to describe a great number of spicy savoury dishes of either Asian or British invention. The word curry is an anglicised version of the Tamil word kari, which means gravy or sauce. It is usually eaten with rice or bread.

#### Trifle

Trifle is a rich and complex sweet dish, even though the name means something of no importance. It is composed of layers of cream, custard, fruit and cakes, often with the addition of liqueur. This dish was listed in the earliest known English cookery book, written in 1390\.

#### Scones

Scones Scones are small British breads of Scottish origin. They can be either sweet or savoury, and can be any shape, though most often they are round. Sweet scones are an essential part of the traditional High Tea.
