## Frequently Asked Questions

![](../../assets/images/carlyleuniversity1.jpg)

##### **How do I make an appointment?**

You can call in to see us at the Castle Tower Building on the main campus or contact us by telephone or email.

##### **How long will I have to wait for an appointment?**

We try to offer a first appointment within 10 working days. However, it may be longer at busy times of the academic year. As there is a high demand for appointments, please make every effort to keep your appointment or let us know at least three days in advance if you no longer need the appointment.

##### **What can I expect at my appointment?**

Your initial appointment will last approximately 30 to 50 minutes. The purpose of this session is to consider the problem you have come with and work out the best course of action with a counsellor. If the counsellor decides that more sessions are needed, we will place your name on the waiting list for regular counselling.

##### **How long will I have to wait if I need regular counselling sessions?**

Waiting times vary depending on the time of year and the demand on the Service, as well as your availability â”€ it can range between one and eight weeks. However, we do try to minimise waiting times, since we know that once a decision has been made to seek help it is hard to have to wait.

##### **How many sessions can I have?**

You may be offered up to six sessions. However, it might be that you need to carry on seeing your counsellor for a longer period. This will be something your counsellor will discuss with you.
