# Fun in the sun â€“ August 2015

_15 August_

It already seems like ages since we set off to Spain for our summer holiday. The feeling of excitement and that early morning flight are a distant memory.

This year we flew to Valencia instead of driving. This was much faster, and more relaxing, but I really hated flying Budget Air. There was hardly any legroom and everything seemed really cramped. But it was nice to get the early morning flight as you get longer on holiday. When we got through passport control and picked our bags up my parents met us.

From the airport we went straight to a cafe for some lunch and then back to their house. Then we quickly unpacked so that the kids could get in the pool. Jason was a bit nervous at first but it didn't take him long to get his confidence and then there was no holding him back. He spent all his time in the pool and would have eaten his meals in there if he could. Zoe loved it too and she was in there nearly as much as Jason.

We went out for delicious meals and went for lovely strolls around the local market. This year we chose to relax much more and spent a lot of time reading and lounging around while the kids messed about in the pool. We only went to the beach once but had a good time playing games on the beach.

One of the best days was when we went to the aquarium and marine park. It was a really good day and the fish were amazing to look at - definitely worth a visit.

We also visited a lovely little bay and Dave, the kids and Dad hired a kayak and had a great time. Mum and I had a laugh watching them try to control it.

Zoe and Jason both improved a lot with their swimming and Dave helped with some jobs around the house and fixing Mum's computer. It was a great holiday with lovely weather.

One night there was a huge storm and I was amazed by the dramatic lightning. I've never seen anything like that before. I sat there and watched it for quite a while everyone else was sleeping. The next morning it was like it had never happened as everything was sunny and dry again.

I just want to say thanks to Mum and Dad again for looking after us and having us to stay in their beautiful home.
