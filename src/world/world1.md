# Holiday â€“ Summer 2015

_29 Juny_

Wow! What an amazing holiday in Spain! I really want to go back!! It was the first time on a plane for me and I was a bit scared because I didn't know what to do. But Mummy kept telling me it was OK and that soon we would be with Granny and Grandad.

She was right and at the airport they were waiting for us. I ran up to them and gave them a hug.

I was really excited when we got to their house and I just wanted to get in the pool. I needed arm bands because I couldn't swim very well. Zoe played with me loads and daddy and grandad both wanted to teach me to swim better. I don't think it was easy for them and I made a fuss because I didn't want to take my arm bands off.

We visited loads of places and were in the car loads. I got really tired because they eat dinner late in Spain and I had to stay up late to eat. Granny made me special food because I didn't like the Spanish food. Granny made lots of dinners and we went out for dinner too.

Every day I played in the pool with Zoe. She taught me to swim underwater and hold my breath. It was great. Mummy played with me too when Zoe wanted to get out of the pool. Also daddy and grandad came in and let me ride around on their backs. I think granny liked watching me swim around.

I'm really proud that I learned to swim better. I jumped in and I could swim the whole length of the pool which was 10 metres. Granny made me a special certificate for that. Everyone clapped and I was very happy. The certificate is on my bedroom wall.

My holiday was amazing and I miss granny and grandad lots. Thank you for letting me play in your pool and I love you both loads xxx.
